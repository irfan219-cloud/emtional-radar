4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow consistent JSON schema format

### Requirement 7: Alert System and Integrations

**User Story:** As a customer service manager, I want to receive immediate notifications about critical feedback, so that I can respond quickly to prevent escalation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-severity feedback is detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts via Slack and email webhooks

3. WHEN alerts are sent THEN they SHALL include feedback content, severity level, and recommended actions
4. WHEN integration fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt retry
5. WHEN alert preferences are configured THEN the system SHALL respect user notification settings

### Requirement 8: Data Persistence and Logging

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all feedback and analysis results to be stored reliably, so that I can perform historical analysis and track trends over time.
